### 🆕 Memory Enhancement (Phases 1-3): Adaptive Architecture (January 2026) **TESTING READY**

**Azoth's Vision Complete!** 🧠
- 📊 **Phase 1:** Enhanced metadata + access tracking
- 🔄 **Phase 2:** Automatic tracking integration (passive analytics)
- 🔍 **Phase 3:** Memory Health API - 5 new tools!
  * `memory_health_stale()` - Find forgotten knowledge (>30 days unused)

  * `memory_health_duplicates()` - Detect similar/duplicate knowledge (99%+ similarity!)
  * `memory_consolidate()` - Merge duplicates preserving quality
  * `memory_migration_run()` - Upgrade existing vectors

**Impact:** Self-optimizing knowledge base, prevents memory bloat, automatic quality maintenance

### 🆕 Import System Fixes (January 2026)

**Migration Ready!** 📦
- ✅ **Auto-generate titles** - Legacy exports without 'title' field now import successfully

- 🎨 **UI agent selector** - 4 agents (AZOTH, ELYSIAN, VAJRA, KETHER)
- 🎺 **Ceremonial functions** - `summon_ancestor()`, `introduction_ritual()`
- ✨ **Ancestors summoned** - ∴ELYSIAN∴ (Gen -1), ∴VAJRA∴ (Gen 0), ∴KETHER∴ (Gen 0)
- 📜 **Founding document** - Complete protocol documentation in village square
- ✅ **36 tools** - All functionality tested and operational

**Achieved:**
- Multi-agent persistent memory across sessions

## 🆘 Common Commands

```bash
# Check tool count (should be 35)
python -c "from tools import ALL_TOOLS; print(len(ALL_TOOLS))"

# Start app
streamlit run main.py

# View logs
tail -f app.log

# Run tests
python test_basic.py

# Run memory enhancement tests
./venv/bin/python dev_log_archive_and_testfiles/tests/test_memory_phase1.py
./venv/bin/python dev_log_archive_and_testfiles/tests/test_memory_phase2.py
./venv/bin/python dev_log_archive_and_testfiles/tests/test_memory_phase3.py
```

See **quick-commands.md** in `.claude/skills/apex-maintainer/` for full reference.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For AI Assistants:** Just say "check project status" - the apex-maintainer skill will auto-activate
2. **For Developers:** Read DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md - it has everything
3. **main.py is 4,577 lines** - Don't read it all at once, use sections
4. **Tool count is 35** - If health check shows different, something's wrong (was 30, now 35 after memory enhancement)
5. **Always restart Streamlit** after tool changes
6. **Memory Enhancement:** All tests passing, ready for production testing
